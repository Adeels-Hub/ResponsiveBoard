<p>This AWS Customer Agreement (this “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) contains the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Services (as defined below) and is an agreement between the applicable AWS Contracting Party specified in Section 12 below (also referred to as “<strong>AWS</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) and you or the entity you represent (“<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>”). This Agreement takes effect when you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Services (the “<strong>Effective Date</strong>”). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor).

<p>1.1 General. You may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. Service Level Agreements and Service Terms apply to certain Services.</p>
<p>1.2 Third-Party Content. Third-Party Content may be used by you at your election. Third-Party Content is governed by this Agreement and, if applicable, separate terms and conditions accompanying such Third-Party Content, which terms and conditions may include separate fees and charges. </p>
<p>1.3 AWS Security. Without limiting Section 8 or your obligations under Section 2.2, we will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.</p>
<p>1.4 Data Privacy. You may specify the AWS regions in which Your Content will be stored. You consent to the storage of Your Content in, and transfer of Your Content into, the AWS regions you select. We will not access or use Your Content except as necessary to maintain or provide the Services, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. We will not (a) disclose Your Content to any government or third party or (b) move Your Content from the AWS regions selected by you; except in each case as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. Unless it would violate the law or a binding order of a governmental body, we will give you notice of any legal requirement or order referred to in this Section 1.4. We will only use your Account Information in accordance with the Privacy Notice, and you consent to such usage. The Privacy Notice does not apply to Your Content.</p>
<p>1.5 Notice of Changes to the Services. We may change or discontinue any of the Services from time to time. We will provide you at least 12 months’ prior notice before discontinuing a material functionality of a Service that we make generally available to customers and that you are using. AWS will not be obligated to provide such notice under this Section 1.5 if the discontinuation is necessary to (a) address an emergency, or risk of harm to the Services or AWS, (b) respond to claims, litigation, or loss of license rights related to third party intellectual property rights, or (c) comply with law, but should any of the preceding occur AWS will provide you with as much prior notice as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>2.1 Your Accounts. You will comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Services. To access the Services, you must have an AWS account associated with a valid email address and a valid form of payment. Unless explicitly permitted by the Service Terms, you will only create one account per email address. Except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account.  </p>
<p>2.2 Your Content. You are responsible for Your Content. You will ensure that Your Content and your and End Users’ use of Your Content or the Services will not violate any of the Policies or any applicable law. </p>
<p>2.3 Your Security and Backup. You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect and backup your accounts and Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routinely archiving Your Content.  </p>
<p>2.4 Log-In Credentials and Account Keys.

<p>2.5 End Users. You will be deemed to have taken any action that you permit, assist or facilitate any person or entity to take related to this Agreement, Your Content or use of the Services. You are responsible for End Users’ use of Your Content and the Services, and for their compliance with your obligations under this Agreement. If you become aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement caused by an End User, you will immediately suspend access to Your Content and the Services by such End User. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User obligating us to provide such support or services. </p>
<h4 id="3-fees-and-payment">3. Fees and Payment.<a class="headerlink" href="#3-fees-and-payment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>3.1 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we reasonably suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Services as described on the AWS Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the AWS Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments. If we suspend your account under Section 4.1 or terminate your use of the Services pursuant to Section 5.2(b)(ii), we may elect not to bill you for fees and charges after suspension unless your account is reinstated.</p>
<p>3.2 Taxes. </p>
<p>(a) Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of Indirect Taxes, except where applicable law requires otherwise. We may charge and you will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or authorized to collect from you. You will provide such information to us as reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which we can claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement. </p>
<p>(b) If the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon Web Services India Private Limited ("AWS India") (formerly known as Amazon Internet Services Private Limited), the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 3.2(b) will apply.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that AWS India may display the applicable fees and charges for the Services on the Site in USD (or such other currency as AWS India may deem fit). However, AWS India will invoice you in INR calculated and converted in accordance with the conversion rate determined by us on the date of invoice ("INR Equivalent Fees"). You will only be liable to pay the INR Equivalent Fees indicated in each invoice.</p>
<p>We will invoice you from our registered office at the address of your establishment (as registered with the tax authorities, if applicable) receiving the Services in accordance with the applicable indirect tax laws.</p>
<p>All fees and charges payable under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or local indirect taxes ("Taxes") that AWS India is legally obligated to charge under applicable law. For the purpose of this clause, local indirect taxes include Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), which includes the Central Goods and Services Tax ("CGST"), the State Goods and Services Tax ("SGST"), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax ("UGST"), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax ("IGST") as may be applicable. The Taxes charged by AWS India will be stated in the invoice pursuant to applicable laws. AWS India may charge and you will pay any applicable Taxes, which are stated separately on the invoice. As per the statutory requirement under GST, you will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST registered address, legal name and GSTIN ("GST Information") in order for AWS India to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable legal requirements. In the event, the GST invoice is incorrect, you will inform us in a timely manner, to enable AWS India to correct the GST tax invoice. AWS India will determine the place of supply for the Services based on the GST Information provided by you and accordingly, charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to us are for our account. You will pay the fees and charges in our invoice in full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If you separately deposit applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the applicable government treasury and issue us a withholding tax certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the withholding tax certificate in original form, we will reimburse to you an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited.  </p>

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Services, or to any products or services sold or distributed by AWS will be adjudicated in the Governing Courts, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Governing Courts, subject to the additional provisions below.</p>
<p>(a) If the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon Web Services, Inc., Amazon Web Services Canada, Inc., Amazon Web Services Korea LLC or Amazon Web Services Singapore Private Limited, the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 11.5(a) will apply. Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that either party may elect to proceed in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement, except that if Amazon Web Services Canada, Inc. is the applicable AWS Contracting Party the Ontario Arbitration Act will apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. Before you may begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter notifying us of your intent to pursue arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its commercial rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA commercial fee schedule. We and you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. We and you further agree that the underlying award in arbitration may be appealed pursuant to the AAA’s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>(b) If the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon Web Services South Africa Proprietary Limited, the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 11.5(b) will apply. Disputes will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the then-applicable rules of the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa, and judgment on the arbitral award must be entered in the Governing Court. The Arbitration Act, No. 42 of 1965 applies to this Agreement. The arbitration will take place in Johannesburg. There will be three arbitrators. The fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the administering authority, if any, will be paid in equal proportion by the parties.</p>
<p><strong>(c) If the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon AWS Serviços Brasil Ltda., the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 11.5(c) will apply. Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, in accordance with the then-applicable Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, and judgment on the arbitral award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration will take place in the City of São Paulo, State of São Paulo, Brazil. There will be three arbitrators. The fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the administering authority, if any, will be paid in equal proportion by the parties. The parties agree that the existence of and information relating to any such arbitration proceedings will not be disclosed by either party and will constitute confidential information.
