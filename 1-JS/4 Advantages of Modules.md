- **Improved Maintainability**: Code is organized into smaller, reusable pieces.
- **Encapsulation**: Each module has its own scope, reducing the risk of global variable conflicts.
- **Standardized**: Works natively in modern browsers and supported by Node.js.
- **Optimization**:  Static structure allows for better performance and tooling (e.g., tree shaking).
