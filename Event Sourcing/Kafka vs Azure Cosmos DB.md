### **Kafka vs Azure Cosmos DB**

- **Purpose**:
    - **Kafka**: A distributed event streaming platform, not a general-purpose database. Kafka is used for messaging and stream processing.
    - **Cosmos DB**: A NoSQL distributed database service with global distribution, low-latency reads/writes, and multi-model support (document, graph, key-value, etc.).
- **Event Storage**:
    - **Kafka** is not a database, but you can store events in Kafka for a configurable period (log retention). It is optimized for sequential write/read operations.
    - **Cosmos DB** is optimized for **long-term, structured data storage** and is better suited when you need to store and query domain-specific data persistently over long periods.
- **Replayability**:
    - **Kafka** is built for replaying events in real-time event streams but doesnâ€™t provide rich querying capabilities like a database.
    - **Cosmos DB** allows querying data across various indices and is better suited when querying stored events for purposes beyond simple replaying (e.g., complex queries).

**Kafka might be better** if you only need to store and replay streams of events, whereas **Cosmos DB** is superior for persistent, structured data with complex querying needs.
