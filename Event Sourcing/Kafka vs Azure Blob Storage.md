### **Kafka vs Azure Blob Storage**

- **Purpose**:
    - **Kafka**: An event streaming platform.
    - **Azure Blob Storage**: A scalable object storage service designed for storing unstructured data such as files, logs, and backups.
- **Event Storage**:
    - **Kafka** stores event logs for a configurable retention period and is designed for high-throughput event streams.
    - **Azure Blob Storage** can store events as files (e.g., JSON or binary blobs) for a long period but lacks Kafka's stream processing and real-time capabilities.
- **Replayability**:
    - **Kafka**: Optimized for replaying streams of events in real-time.
    - **Blob Storage**: With custom logic, you can store and replay events, but itâ€™s not optimized for real-time streaming or high-throughput processing.

**Kafka might be better** if you need a real-time streaming platform with replayability. **Azure Blob Storage** is better suited for archival and long-term storage of event data but lacks real-time processing features.
