### **Kafka vs Azure Service Bus**

- **Purpose**:
    - **Kafka**: Focused on event streaming and distributed message processing with high-throughput and real-time capabilities.
    - **Azure Service Bus**: Designed for enterprise messaging patterns such as message queues, pub/sub, and asynchronous communication between systems.
- **Messaging Patterns**:
    - **Azure Service Bus** supports enterprise-grade messaging patterns such as **FIFO**, message **ordering**, **dead-letter queues (DLQs)**, and **exactly-once delivery** semantics, making it ideal for workflows that require guaranteed message delivery and order.
    - **Kafka** focuses more on scalability and real-time stream processing but lacks some of the built-in messaging guarantees (e.g., exactly-once delivery) that Service Bus offers.
- **Replayability**:
    - **Kafka** natively supports replayability of events from a log-based storage system, making it suitable for **event sourcing**.
    - **Azure Service Bus** is more transient and doesn’t provide long-term replayability like Kafka (it’s more about reliable message delivery).

**Kafka might be better** if you're building a large-scale, high-throughput, real-time event streaming system, while **Azure Service Bus** is superior for traditional enterprise messaging scenarios requiring more complex workflows with built-in guarantees.
