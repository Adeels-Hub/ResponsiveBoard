### 1. **Kafka vs Azure Event Hubs**

- **Purpose**:
    - **Kafka**: Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput and low-latency message ingestion. It's designed for real-time data pipelines and stream processing.
    - **Azure Event Hubs**: Event Hubs is Azure’s big data streaming platform designed for similar use cases like Kafka—high-throughput event ingestion and streaming.
- **Throughput and Performance**:
    - Kafka can handle extremely high throughput (millions of messages per second) with very low latency, making it a great choice for real-time analytics and complex event-driven architectures.
    - Event Hubs can also handle high-throughput workloads, but Kafka’s architecture is more flexible when dealing with extreme scalability needs.
- **Replayability**:
    - Both Kafka and Event Hubs allow replaying of events by consumers.
    - **Kafka** offers more control over retention and allows storing events for longer periods (potentially indefinitely) across distributed storage.
    - **Event Hubs** allows configurable retention periods (up to 7 days, with extensions available), but Kafka generally provides more flexibility in long-term event storage.

**Kafka might be better** if you need extremely high throughput and fine-grained control over event retention. **Event Hubs** is a fully managed service on Azure and easier to integrate if you're already using the Azure ecosystem.
