- The state hook allows us to add state to function components.
- Hooks can only be called at the top level of components.
- React updates state in an asynchronous manner, so updates are not applied immediately. Instead, theyâ€™re batched and applied at once after all event handlers have finished execution. Once the state is updated, React re-renders our component.
- Avoid deeply nested state objects as they can be hard to update and maintain.
- A pure function is one that always returns the same result given the same input. Pure functions should not modify objects outside of the function.
- To keep state as minimal as possible, avoid redundant state variables that can be computed from existing variables.
