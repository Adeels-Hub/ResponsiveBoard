With CSS-in-JS, we define all the styles for a component alongside its code. Like CSS modules, this provides scoping for CSS classes and eliminates conflicts. It also makes it easier for us to change or delete a component without affecting other components.

If you prioritize simplicity or have a global design system with reusable styles, consider **CSS Modules** or **utility-first CSS frameworks** like Tailwind CSS.
For common css use
	Theme Providers for Shared Variables
	Abstract Common Styles into Reusable Components
